Shutdown v1.3 for OS/2 2.x
--------------------------

Shutdown is a utility to schedule a system shutdown. This can be done in several
ways. The exact commandline is as follows:

SHUTDOWN.EXE [[/axxxx] | [[/dyyyymmdd] [/thhmm]]]

where:
             /a - shutdown after xxxx seconds
             /d - shutdown on YYYYMMDD (Year, Month, Day)
             /t - shutdown on HHMM (24 hour format)
             /? - show a help screen
             SHUTDOWN without options will shutdown the system immediately

You cannot use the /a option in combination with /d and/or /t. Command line
parsing is case sensitive so you should use /a instead of /A.


Examples:
---------

SHUTDOWN /A60
this will shutdown the system in one minute

SHUTDOWN /D931231 /T2359
this will shutdown the system one minute before new year

SHUTDOWN /T0500
this will shutdown the system at five in the morning

SHUTDOWN /D940101
this will shutdown the system on January 1 1994 at midnight
